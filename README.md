# Python Project

Goal: 

(a) Compute equity premium for every quarter for VFINX and VDIGX. 

(b) Compute mean, stdev, and their ratio (Sharpe ratio) for each. Compare!

(c) Regress equity premium for VDIGX upon equity premium for VFINX. Find alpha, beta, and sigma.

(d) Also find confidence intervals for alpha and beta. 

(e) Test normality of residuals using QQ plot, Jarque-Bera, Shapiro-Wilk tests. If p is large this is good (we can assume they are normal). 

(f) If (e) fails, do (c)-(e) for annual instead of quarterly equity premia. Annual premium = sum of 4 quarterly equity premia. 

Data can be found in 3MonthTreasury.xlsx and DividendStocks.xlsx
